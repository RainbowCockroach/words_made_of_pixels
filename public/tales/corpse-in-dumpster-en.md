Unable to bear the rotting smell in the kitchen, had to go take out the trash at 3 AM. Light drizzle. Tossing the garbage bag into the bin, suddenly I noticed two bare white legs pale as chalk on top of the black plastic bags.  
My neighbor, not a shred of clothing covering his body, lying sprawled in the trash bin. Eyes vacant, but his face still rosy, not the ashen pale color of a corpse. Looking closer, his chest was rising and falling slightly. Still breathing, but no response when shook and called out.  
Shuddering, I called the police. They came, shined their lights, examined for a long while. Then one officer sighed.

"This one needs the body cleanup crew"

\* \* \*

After many phone calls, a group of people in environmental sanitation uniforms arrived, simply carried the neighbor out and put him in a large black bag. A strange young man was called out by the police.

"Is this your body?"  
"That's right, I just changed bodies, that old body I don't use anymore"  
"Bodies are considered special waste, you can't throw it like normal household waste. Body waste must be collected at designated points. You should have read this in the handbook you were given when you immigrated!"  
"Ah, sorry, I didn't pay attention" - the guy said embarrassedly.

This person then had to pay a fine. He scratched his head and smiled sheepishly at me
"Sorry about that, in the middle of the night making you startled. My old body was quite aged, and also had diabetes. I just bought this new body. Cost a lot, but worth the money..."

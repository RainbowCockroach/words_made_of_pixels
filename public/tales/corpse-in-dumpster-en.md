Unable to bear the rotting smell in the kitchen, I went to take out the trash at 3 AM. It was drizzling. Tossing the garbage bag into the dumpster, I suddenly noticed two bare white legs on top of the black plastic bags.

My neighbor, without a stitch of clothing, lying limp in the trash bin. His eyes were lifeless, but his face was still rosy, not the pale color of corpses. Shuddering, I looked more closelyhis chest was still rising and falling gently. Still breathing, but no response when I shook and called out.

I called the police. They came, shined their flashlights, examined for a long while. Then one officer sighed.

"We'll have to call the body disposal team."

After many phone calls, a group of people came and just carried my neighbor out and put him into a large black bag. A strange young man was called aside by the police.

"Is this your body?"
"Oh yes, I just got a body replacement, I don't use that old body anymore."
"Bodies are considered special waste, you can't just throw them in civilian trash bins. Body waste must be collected at designated points. You should have read this in the handbook you were given when you immigrated!"
"Ah, sorry, I didn't pay attention"the guy looked flustered.

This person then had to pay a fine. He scratched his head and smiled sheepishly at me:
"Sorry about that, startling you in the middle of the night. My old body was quite old, and it had diabetes too. I just finished buying this new body. Cost a lot, but it's worth the money..."
